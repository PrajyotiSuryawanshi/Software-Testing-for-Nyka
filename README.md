First of all I developed a mind map using xmind app. In xmind app I write module, submodules. You can see I covered scope, objective, approach, testing feature and using tools etc in different design.once complete mind map developed test plan using doc in test plan detailed information about objective, scope, testing feature and all.
After that i developed test scenario using google sheet in that scenario testing include various testing functionality features according to work-flow such as sign up, sign in,
Search functionality add to cart functionality, payment method etc. include scenario id and priority no. such as P0, P1 & P2 based on testing priorities.
	After that I developed various types of test cases based on the test scenario in template including test scenario id, test scenario, test cases, test step, expected result.
And after testing the function write actual result and status such as pass or fail. Also include a comment section in the test cases template.
	After that I faced a lot of challenges in bug reports. I create bug reports based on test execution results in that functionality defect or performance defect or usability defects. The bug report template includes bug id, description, step to reproduce, expected result, actual result and severity section. Thatâ€™s it about manual software testing and the importance of creating user friendly applications.</p>
